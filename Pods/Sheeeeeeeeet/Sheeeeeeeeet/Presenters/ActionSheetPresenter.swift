 Action sheet presenters are used by Sheeeeeeeeet to present
 action sheets in different ways, e.g. with a default bottom
 slide, showing a popover from the tapped view etc.
 
 When implementing this protocol, `present(in:from:)` is the
 standard way to present an action sheet, while `dismiss` is
 the standard way to dismiss it.
 
 `isDismissableWithTapOnBackground` is used to specify if an
 action sheet can be dismissed by tapping on the background.
